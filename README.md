# AudioNotes
A minimal viable mobile application that capture offline audio notes, store them locally, lists saved recording, and enable playback.

# Architecture & Scalability
This application follows MVVM that separates the UI from the business logic.

# Next To Come
Real-time Waveform Visualization: Display a dynamic waveform during recording and
playback.

● Background Recording: Enable recording even when the app is minimized.

● Smart Tagging: Implement AI-assisted or auto-generated tagging to enhance
organization.

● Offline-to-Cloud Synchronization: Sync audio files once connectivity is available, with
robust conflict resolution.
